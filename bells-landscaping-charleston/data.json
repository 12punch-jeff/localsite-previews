When I started calling around, Josh was quick to show up and provided a proposal that I could review prior to starting the work. His crews finished the project ahead of schedule and did a great job cleaning up at the end of the 2.5 days. Glad we picked Bell's Landscaping for our project - looking forward to years to come with the new lawn! Definitely recommend - call Josh if you are thinking about a lawn/landscape project.",

Hands down the best customer service in the low country, Bell's sets the standard when it comes to expectation management, punctuality and communication.
