      "text": "Back in November, my daughter had a plumbing issue at her house. She and her husband called another company who came out and told her that she had a blocked drain and she would need to spend $27,000 to rip up the floor and run new drains between the bathroom and the kitchen. She was in a panic. It was C&C Meyers. They would not even put a camera down the line to see where the issue was.\nI have used Blitch many times in the past and suggested they give them a call. They came out the next day and put a camera down the pipe identified the problem and recommended a course of action.\nThey showed up the following Monday morning and in two days had run a new pipe and cut the old one. The total bill was less than 1/5!  They left their area immaculate every day and kept everyone informed. My son-in-law is an engineer and was super impressed. I could not recommend Blitch highly enough. They will always be my first and only call when it comes to plumbing.",

Their highly skilled technicians are always polite and explain everything and cost up front. My most recent issue, old copper pipes leaking. Their technicians DW and Damien went above and beyond.\nI would highly recommend having Blitch plumbing as your only company to call.\nRobin Crisp",

      "text": "Blitch Plumbing came to my rescue once again! We've used them a few times now, and every single experience has been consistently wonderful. They're always quick to respond and super professional. I called yesterday afternoon about a leak, expecting to wait at least a day or two, but they scheduled me right away for today. They called prior to arriving, then their plumber even apologized for arriving two hours early—talk about great service! He fixed the issue quickly, cleaned everything up, and was respectful of my home. The price was fair, but honestly, the level of care and attention was above and beyond. Highly recommend!",

      "text": "I'm so grateful for Blitch Plumbing.  I live in an older house, and have had to use their services many times for various repairs.  Lucky me, Ben came to the rescue this morning to fix a running toilet that no amount of \"jiggling\" could remedy.  He fixed the toilet, made me smile, and my day started on a higher note than I expected.  So thanks to Blitch again for friendly and professional service that's also very timely!",
