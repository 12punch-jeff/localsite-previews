They planted 20 Ligustrums along both sides of my fence, mulched, planted some additional plants out front of the home and did an absolutely wonderful job.  Best part to me was the communication.

He guided us with both design and plant selections, and we went with most of what he suggested. The project itself had an incredible group of workers. They worked tirelessly in really HOT conditions. The job had a few hiccups as plants needed to be exchanged, but there was never a problem. Even when I got a little picky about some plants, they quickly and happily met my expectations. Harrison, our hands-on guy was knowledgeable on plants, soil and even bugs! We give him 6*'s for his attentiveness... and lovely southern manners. The best part was watching our Palmetto arrive! And we absolutely love the end results...as do our neighbors.\n\nEverything was completed within it estimated time, clean up was good, though we had to ask them to do a little more cleanup on some of the concrete left in the grass. We do have a few shrubs we're monitoring to make sure they didn't suffer from shock, but we know that Palmetto, Jason and his team will stand behind them.\n\nWe have already recommended them to our neighbors, and I'm sure we'll be seeing them around this spring.\n\nThank you Palmetto for our beautiful outdoor space!",

I had a small little project that I needed help with, and they came down here and completed it in about 1 hour. Kevin, and Eric, and their crew are some really awesome guys! I cleared out a 20 ft by 20 ft area of some really thick vines, bushes, and small trees by hand, which took me a couple weeks to do. But there was no way I could have gotten the stumps, and roots up, and leveled it out by hand with yard tools. They came down here and knocked it out for me in no time! I called around to a lot of places, and they absolutely gave me the best price in town!!! They do great work, are very professional, and care about their neighbors. I highly recommend New Leaf Landscaping Construction and will definitely use them again! My name is J.D. Bonds and I own Port City Painting LLC in North Charleston. I know my review says Ryan Wachstetter and that's because I bought my phone from him and his Google account is on this phone. He's my cousin. Ryan says they did a really great job too!",

        "text": "I live in Wescott in the Farms. This is a relatively new company our HOA has hired and it has been nothing but headaches since they started a few months ago.\n\nThey have repeatedly skipped my house when doing the leaf blowing after moving. This leaves my patio covered in grass clippings and yard waste. I have written to the HOA to complain and have someone reach out and no one has ever reached out.\n\nThe final straw was two weeks ago. They came through with the mower and the edger. I noticed my clematis that has been growing up trellis for several years was wilted and looked like it was dying. I checked the base and it was completely severed, just inches above root.\n\nI had to write 3 emails and escalate this to the HOA president to get a response. No one from this company has ever contacted me.\n\nI noticed today they had done the same thing to my other clematis. Severed at the root. I’m not sure if this is just total negligence on their part or what.\n\nThey have also repeated hacked away at any plant that wasn’t actively blooming in my garden beds. Lots of lantana that had growing was hacked away and every time I get it to start growing again they come through and cut it away again.\n\nI want my clematis replaced and them to stay out of my flowerbeds.",
