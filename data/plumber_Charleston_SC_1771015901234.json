Tommy replaced the gas line and did a great job.\nProject 2- Shower/ bath replaced in 1945 house.  Project was complicated by extensive water damage but LimRic did a phenomenal job.  Kenny provided reasonable estimates while technician Trevon and apprentice Kevin completed the job on time and on budget.",

They took all my information down and a short time later I was contacted via text with the technician's information, a short bio, and a photo so I knew who to look out for. Hagan showed up and immediately recognized that I would need a new tank due to the type of leak I had. He explained the process and what I could expect and left to go get a new tank. He returned a short time later and installed the tank with zero complications providing A+ quality work. I would 100 percent use Lim-Ric again and without a doubt recommend them and their technicians to everyone. Great job Hagan and Lim-ric!",

Last time I used them, they had to replace a sensor that cost me about $700. This time they are having to replace another sensor and a motherboard, and it’s gonna cost almost $2000. Unfortunately, I’m going out of town and don’t have time to shop around. Great service and timely but I’m sure there are more frugal options",

The next day I called a LimRic competitor who I held a membership with to see if they could come out ASAP - they told me they could get to me 5 days from then which was not going to work, despite paying for a monthly membership. I called LimRic and they sent Mike out hours later who walked me through the situation and gave me an honest opinion on what to do. I bought a new disposal and since I already had the appt with the other company I planned to have them install it. That day came and they did not show up when they said they would. I called and they told me they would get to me when they got to me, that was not an option for me. I called LimRic again and let them know that if they could somehow make it work to send someone out to install the new disposal, I would cancel my current membership and move to LimRic. They were able to send Mike out again, on the same day just hours after I spoke to them and I switched my membership right then. I was asking a lot of them but they accommodated my requests and were honest the entire time. Mike was fantastic and I really appreciate what he and LimRic did for me. Could not recommend this company enough!",

The chemicals cost $30 on Amazon & takes an hour to do. Certainly not worth $400! Eventhough they do good work, they're outpricing themselves in the plumbing field.",

They installed my furnace and completed a number of a  jobs. I have never been disappointed with their exceptional service..\n\nFrom the very first interaction, Tony, Paul, and Joel provided truly personal, attentive, white-glove service. They took the time to explain everything clearly, treated my home (and me) with respect, and followed through exactly as promised. Their workmanship is top-notch, meticulous, and dependable—this is a company that takes real pride in doing things the right way. Again, they do it right the fIRST time..\n\nWhat sets Fix-It apart, however, goes far beyond plumbing and HVAC. When I lost my beloved husband, the entire office sent me a handwritten condolence card signed by everyone. That level of kindness and thoughtfulness is rare these days—and deeply meaningful. It spoke volumes about the character of this company and the people who work there. Thank you to all and especially Madison.\n\nI am incredibly grateful for Tony, Paul, Joel, and the entire Fix-It team. They are compassionate, professional, responsive, and simply amazing. If you want a company you can trust completely—one that treats you like a person, not a number—Fix-It Plumbing and HVAC is the gold standard. I only wish all companies had this professionalism. Again, they are the GOLD STANDARD.",

Christian is a clean cut and well mannered young man. He was very thorough and explained what he was doing along the way and made recommendations as he serviced the furnace and air conditioning. Christian took pictures of the components and those were attached to the invoice that was promptly emailed to me. There were no surprises and I wasn't pressured into buying anything else. It is a wonderful to have a company that has only sent polite and knowledgeable technicians to take care of my heating and cooling needs.

Joshua Brown was my technician and he did an amazing job. He took his time to explain everything and even took pictures so I could see the unit in the attic.

He had to run to get a part for the A/C and when I returned he was just pulling off everything is fixed.  He talked me into duct cleaning !  WOW!! you must be joking about the price BUT the vents haven't been cleaned for at least 17 years.  I bought the home Jan 2014. I'm going to go with the duct cleaning but I hope the firm takes into consideration  my 27 year veteran status so I don't suffer night mares about the money.  I am a good loyal customer and wish to continue with the Fix-It techs.  They know what they are doing !!!!!\nThe other two guys were excellent with the duct cleaning.  We can breathe clean air again.  It also seems more warm air comes through the fresh duct-work!  thanks again.  Lee Wachter",

I was worried I would have to wait forever long for it to be replaced but they handled it with efficiency!! They were great conversationalists! Not only in explaining what they were doing, but overall just talking w us while they were working. When i am one-day (hopefully) a future homeowner, I will be reaching out to this company and hopefully Allen and Felix for all my plumbing needs 🥰",

They were fast, efficient, affordable, and handled the issue with complete resolve.\n\nChris was an amazing and knowledgeable technician who was even willing to show up at five in the morning so we could get everything taken care of without missing a beat in our business operations.\n\nI would certainly highly recommend Charles Towne Plumbing, and we will absolutely be using them for our future needs. You should do the same.",

All work was done neatly and professionally with high quality materials, the team was careful to lay down floor protection anywhere they worked, and followed up after work was complete to make sure all was as it should be. Very easy to work with, communicated well, and attentive to their work. Would gladly recommend to friends and family.",

They were onsite for 45 minutes to replace the toilet flange only as I decided to do the water line myself. The quote for the water line was $250.00 and it took me 5 minutes to complete after a quick visit to the plumbing supply store. Parts for the water line was $11.23. This is obviously where we are headed with the shortage of tradesmen.",

All of our bathroom faucets were running very slow and light flows, and Jody worked on each one, telling me exactly what he was doing and why, not only fixing my problems, but educating me along the way.  He was pleasant, personable and professional.  This is exactly what I want when someone comes to my house to do work.

She and her husband called another company who came out and told her that she had a blocked drain and she would need to spend $27,000 to rip up the floor and run new drains between the bathroom and the kitchen. She was in a panic. It was C&C Meyers. They would not even put a camera down the line to see where the issue was.\nI have used Blitch many times in the past and suggested they give them a call. They came out the next day and put a camera down the pipe identified the problem and recommended a course of action.\nThey showed up the following Monday morning and in two days had run a new pipe and cut the old one. The total bill was less than 1/5!  They left their area immaculate every day and kept everyone informed. My son-in-law is an engineer and was super impressed. I could not recommend Blitch highly enough. They will always be my first and only call when it comes to plumbing.",
