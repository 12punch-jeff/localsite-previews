      "text": "Fix-It Plumbing and HVAC in Charleston, SC is simply outstanding—not just for their technical expertise, but for the genuine care, professionalism, and humanity they bring to their work. They installed my furnace and completed a number of a  jobs. I have never been disappointed with their exceptional service..\n\nFrom the very first interaction, Tony, Paul, and Joel provided truly personal, attentive, white-glove service. They took the time to explain everything clearly, treated my home (and me) with respect, and followed through exactly as promised. Their workmanship is top-notch, meticulous, and dependable—this is a company that takes real pride in doing things the right way. Again, they do it right the fIRST time..\n\nWhat sets Fix-It apart, however, goes far beyond plumbing and HVAC. When I lost my beloved husband, the entire office sent me a handwritten condolence card signed by everyone. That level of kindness and thoughtfulness is rare these days—and deeply meaningful. It spoke volumes about the character of this company and the people who work there. Thank you to all and especially Madison.\n\nI am incredibly grateful for Tony, Paul, Joel, and the entire Fix-It team. They are compassionate, professional, responsive, and simply amazing. If you want a company you can trust completely—one that treats you like a person, not a number—Fix-It Plumbing and HVAC is the gold standard. I only wish all companies had this professionalism. Again, they are the GOLD STANDARD.",

He provided clear photos, walked me through the issues step by step, and made sure to consult with his supervisor and the finance department to give me accurate information. I really appreciated how transparent and patient he was. It made a stressful situation much easier to understand. Highly recommend their services.",

      "text": "Christian did an outstanding job. I had a very good experience when they sent a crew to replsce my AC unit in July and this was the first service of the unit. Christian is a clean cut and well mannered young man. He was very thorough and explained what he was doing along the way and made recommendations as he serviced the furnace and air conditioning. Christian took pictures of the components and those were attached to the invoice that was promptly emailed to me. There were no surprises and I wasn't pressured into buying anything else. It is a wonderful to have a company that has only sent polite and knowledgeable technicians to take care of my heating and cooling needs. Thank you Christian for taking the time to make sure everything is working as it should be.",

      "text": "This company treats veterans with the respect they deserve. They offer free tune up/checks on your heating/air conditioning unit. Joshua Brown was my technician and he did an amazing job. He took his time to explain everything and even took pictures so I could see the unit in the attic. I had concerns about my unit being “at the end of its usefulness” and he helped me get a great deal on a new one installed today. Dylan and Andrew got the new unit installed quickly and extremely knowledgeable in what they do. I would 100% recommend this company to anyone especially veterans!",

      "text": "My Mr. Fix-it is Mexican with a wife and two kids.  I said we will probably meet at Publix Cane Bay !!  He's a good tech. He had to run to get a part for the A/C and when I returned he was just pulling off everything is fixed.  He talked me into duct cleaning !  WOW!! you must be joking about the price BUT the vents haven't been cleaned for at least 17 years.  I bought the home Jan 2014. I'm going to go with the duct cleaning but I hope the firm takes into consideration  my 27 year veteran status so I don't suffer night mares about the money.  I am a good loyal customer and wish to continue with the Fix-It techs.  They know what they are doing !!!!!\nThe other two guys were excellent with the duct cleaning.  We can breathe clean air again.  It also seems more warm air comes through the fresh duct-work!  thanks again.  Lee Wachter",
