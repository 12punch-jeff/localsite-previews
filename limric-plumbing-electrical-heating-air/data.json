Tommy replaced the gas line and did a great job.\nProject 2- Shower/ bath replaced in 1945 house.  Project was complicated by extensive water damage but LimRic did a phenomenal job.  Kenny provided reasonable estimates while technician Trevon and apprentice Kevin completed the job on time and on budget.",

      "text": "From the initial call to installation everything was seamless. They took all my information down and a short time later I was contacted via text with the technician's information, a short bio, and a photo so I knew who to look out for. Hagan showed up and immediately recognized that I would need a new tank due to the type of leak I had. He explained the process and what I could expect and left to go get a new tank. He returned a short time later and installed the tank with zero complications providing A+ quality work. I would 100 percent use Lim-Ric again and without a doubt recommend them and their technicians to everyone. Great job Hagan and Lim-ric!",

Andrew let me know ahead of time,  thankfully. But as a single mom, I now have to find a handyman to fix all this.",

      "text": "Lamont was very nice and helpful . This is the second time that I have used them. I feel like their parts could be a lot cheaper and or above average price. Last time I used them, they had to replace a sensor that cost me about $700. This time they are having to replace another sensor and a motherboard, and it’s gonna cost almost $2000. Unfortunately, I’m going out of town and don’t have time to shop around. Great service and timely but I’m sure there are more frugal options",

      "text": "5 stars! On Christmas Day my disposal went out, we had family staying with us so it was a bit of an emergency. The next day I called a LimRic competitor who I held a membership with to see if they could come out ASAP - they told me they could get to me 5 days from then which was not going to work, despite paying for a monthly membership. I called LimRic and they sent Mike out hours later who walked me through the situation and gave me an honest opinion on what to do. I bought a new disposal and since I already had the appt with the other company I planned to have them install it. That day came and they did not show up when they said they would. I called and they told me they would get to me when they got to me, that was not an option for me. I called LimRic again and let them know that if they could somehow make it work to send someone out to install the new disposal, I would cancel my current membership and move to LimRic. They were able to send Mike out again, on the same day just hours after I spoke to them and I switched my membership right then. I was asking a lot of them but they accommodated my requests and were honest the entire time. Mike was fantastic and I really appreciate what he and LimRic did for me. Could not recommend this company enough!",
