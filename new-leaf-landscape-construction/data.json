      "text": "I give New Leaf Landscaping Construction 5 stars out of 5! I live on the same street as their business. I had a small little project that I needed help with, and they came down here and completed it in about 1 hour. Kevin, and Eric, and their crew are some really awesome guys! I cleared out a 20 ft by 20 ft area of some really thick vines, bushes, and small trees by hand, which took me a couple weeks to do. But there was no way I could have gotten the stumps, and roots up, and leveled it out by hand with yard tools. They came down here and knocked it out for me in no time! I called around to a lot of places, and they absolutely gave me the best price in town!!! They do great work, are very professional, and care about their neighbors. I highly recommend New Leaf Landscaping Construction and will definitely use them again! My name is J.D. Bonds and I own Port City Painting LLC in North Charleston. I know my review says Ryan Wachstetter and that's because I bought my phone from him and his Google account is on this phone. He's my cousin. Ryan says they did a really great job too!",

      "text": "I live in Wescott in the Farms. This is a relatively new company our HOA has hired and it has been nothing but headaches since they started a few months ago.\n\nThey have repeatedly skipped my house when doing the leaf blowing after moving. This leaves my patio covered in grass clippings and yard waste. I have written to the HOA to complain and have someone reach out and no one has ever reached out.\n\nThe final straw was two weeks ago. They came through with the mower and the edger. I noticed my clematis that has been growing up trellis for several years was wilted and looked like it was dying. I checked the base and it was completely severed, just inches above root.\n\nI had to write 3 emails and escalate this to the HOA president to get a response. No one from this company has ever contacted me.\n\nI noticed today they had done the same thing to my other clematis. Severed at the root. I’m not sure if this is just total negligence on their part or what.\n\nThey have also repeated hacked away at any plant that wasn’t actively blooming in my garden beds. Lots of lantana that had growing was hacked away and every time I get it to start growing again they come through and cut it away again.\n\nI want my clematis replaced and them to stay out of my flowerbeds.",
