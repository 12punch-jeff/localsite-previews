      "text": "The entire process with Palmetto was amazing. The initial consultation with Jason was exactly what we needed. He guided us with both design and plant selections, and we went with most of what he suggested. The project itself had an incredible group of workers. They worked tirelessly in really HOT conditions. The job had a few hiccups as plants needed to be exchanged, but there was never a problem. Even when I got a little picky about some plants, they quickly and happily met my expectations. Harrison, our hands-on guy was knowledgeable on plants, soil and even bugs! We give him 6*'s for his attentiveness... and lovely southern manners. The best part was watching our Palmetto arrive! And we absolutely love the end results...as do our neighbors.\n\nEverything was completed within it estimated time, clean up was good, though we had to ask them to do a little more cleanup on some of the concrete left in the grass. We do have a few shrubs we're monitoring to make sure they didn't suffer from shock, but we know that Palmetto, Jason and his team will stand behind them.\n\nWe have already recommended them to our neighbors, and I'm sure we'll be seeing them around this spring.\n\nThank you Palmetto for our beautiful outdoor space!",

      "text": "One of the best experiences we’ve had.  Jason was so patient with us as we worked through different changes to get exactly what we wanted.  Planned an extended patio, a walkway, round planting beds, round patio with fire pit center and 6 pallets of sod.  Then, Benito and the crew installed exactly as rendered.  Hard working crew is an understatement as they finished everything within a week just as promised.  We love their work and our yard now.  There’s no question that we’ll call Palmetto Landscaping and Design for all our future landscaping jobs.",

      "text": "We could not be more pleased with Palmetto Landscaping and Design. They designed and installed our patio as well sculpted our garden beds and installed new sod. The crew worked extremely hard even with the extra burden of record heat. The crew demonstrated time and time again their pride in their work. Elvis, the crew lead is that rare combination of creative and detailed (right brain and left brain). We would wholeheartedly recommend Palmetto.",

They exceeded my expectations with my new Hardscape patio and artificial turf install!\nIn fact this same group was able to haul in 400 tons of granite for my driveway and dirt for my workshop pad! They were on time and nice people. Will continue to do business with Griffin and crew!",
