He's provided countless plumbing repairs for us at our home and medical practice for many years. He's done tankless heater service, water heater repair and replacement, replaced water lines, installed new plumbing lines, replaced sinks and hardware, cleared clogged toilets and drains, fixed and replaced toilets, repaired and installed new showers, just about anything plumbing you can think of - he's done for us. He's also come to our rescue for many minor plumbing repairs and also some very serious/larger emergency plumbing repairs. He is the most honest and hardworking person you will find in this industry. He is exceptionally skilled and treats all customers promptly and with consideration for their home/business. We are grateful for his service. As a result, Avery & Sons is the one company I recommend with confidence frequently as the service is truly always the best.",

As a broker, I refer Chris to all of my clients and the feedback is always the same: he’s punctual, professional, and gets the job done right the first time.\n\nHis pricing is fair, his work ethic is exceptional, and he treats every homeowner with genuine respect. Chris is not only a true expert in his craft, but also a wonderful person who cares about the quality of his work and the people he serves.\n\nI highly recommend Chris Devlin for any plumbing needs. You won’t find better.",
