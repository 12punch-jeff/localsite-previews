      "text": "Today I was blessed by the presence of Felix and Allen when my apartment complex had an issue with my water heater. I was worried I would have to wait forever long for it to be replaced but they handled it with efficiency!! They were great conversationalists! Not only in explaining what they were doing, but overall just talking w us while they were working. When i am one-day (hopefully) a future homeowner, I will be reaching out to this company and hopefully Allen and Felix for all my plumbing needs 🥰",

They explained everything they were doing at each step and made sure to stick around until the issue was properly resolved (which included some work from the city!). Can’t thank them enough, will definitely recommend and call again if needed!",

The service team (Jordan, Marc, PK, Andrew, and Wes) have been incredibly responsive, professional, and helpful every step of the way. They’ve been quick to respond to service calls, taken the time to clearly explain issues and solutions, and consistently completed work in a timely manner. Having a reliable team like this during a transition makes a huge difference, and we truly appreciate their support and attention to detail. Highly recommend Blue Collar for their service and professionalism.",
