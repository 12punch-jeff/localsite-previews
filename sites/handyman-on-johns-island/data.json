      "text": "Kenny was extremely professional, courteous, and communicative. He came to fix structural damage to a bedroom ceiling and we also asked if he would install fans and a light fixture while here. He fixed it all and took extra care to paint and clean everything up. He talked us through his process and outlined pricing very clearly. As new home owners we were very grateful to have his knowledge and kindness - he even stopped to help a neighbor kid fix his bike chain and let us know one our pipes were leaking outside. For issues moving forward we will definitely be calling Kenny!",

      "text": "Kenny completed several projects at my home today, including installing a post in my backyard for a birdhouse, installing shelves and hanging a large and heavy wall art.\nKenny was prompt and from the start, he was  polite and made sure he knew exactly how I wanted each project done. He went right to work and did a great job. His rate are reasonable and I could not be happier. Thanks so much",
