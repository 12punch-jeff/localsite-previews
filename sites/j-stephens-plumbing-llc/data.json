      "text": "Indoor shower head broke immediately after installation, owner replaced and said it was likely over tightened. It failed again and was leaking a couple of months later and would not guarantee work. Spent $285 to install an outdoor shower head supplied by them in October, couple of months later it fell off and would not guarantee work again. Very disappointing, I have been a customer for years and will be looking for a new plumber unfortunately.",

      "text": "Kyle did a great job changing the cartridge in the shower handle valve, as we could suddenly not turn it on. He is very knowledgeable, efficient, professional and competent. He changed the part in less than half hour with no mess left behind. Gave us one year warranty.\nAppointment was timely. Called Monday and service was scheduled for Tuesday.\nWould request Kyle again for future plumbing needs..\nCost was $338.00.",

Randall and Lee did a fantastic job on the two service calls over the last two days. They responded quickly, resolved the issues quickly, and communicated excellently throughout. They are great partners to my STR business as their quick response and resolutions help ensure guest satisfaction. Plus, J Stephens honored the warranty. I'm a pleased and loyal customer!",

      "text": "I wrote the review below several months ago.   Since that time the company has been completely unresponsive.  Myself and my neighbor have called them nearly twenty times to come replace a recirculating pump that they ordered and told us was now in stock.   We have left MULTIPLE voicemails and I have talked to three different people who say the service department would contact us.  NOTHING HAS HAPPENED.   So, at this point I am no longer recommending J Stephens as their service response has been HORRIBLE.  If you are thinking about plumbing, get another company.\nPrevious review below, now completely wrong.\nI have had several things done by J Stephens.  Always great service.  Axel is a great technician, knowledgeable, courteous and efficient.  Best plumbing service I have ever had.",
