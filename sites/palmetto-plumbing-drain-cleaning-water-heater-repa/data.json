      "text": "I just had Palmetto Plumbing put in a new toilet for me, after a couple other unreliable plumbers failed to. As I run a business too, I know how difficult it is. So I appreciate their stellar service that much more. They were as punctual as possible, knowledgeable, tidy, efficient and courteous! I am glad I happened to find and follow up with them on this matter :)",

      "text": "I called Palmetto Plumbing on a holiday weekend Saturday night around 11PM with a plumbing emergency. Stephen arrived at my home quickly after the call was placed. He was very kind, professional and thorough. Prior to calling Palmetto Plumbing, I had tried all the big name companies in the area (Limric, Blitch, Fix-It 24/7, C&C Myers) who claim to offer “emergency after hours and 24/7 emergency calls” but was told either they did not have anyone available and could not come until Monday. I would highly recommend them as a fair and reliable local family owned business who actually did provide emergency call service.",

      "text": "Steve was amazing and VERY affordable for the work he had to do!! His knowledge is unmatched, every issue whether it was bolts rusted together he had to cut through, to fittings being different sizes, he had the right tools and a solution for everything.  He rebuilt all the parts and pieces inside of one of our toilets, replaced another toilet, and re-ran all of the plumbing and fixtures for our vanity. A true expert plumber, which is very hard to find these days, especially at a reasonable price! Thank you Steve!!",

      "text": "Exceptional Service & Professionalism\n\nPalmetto Plumbing came to my home yesterday, and I couldn’t be more impressed with the experience. From start to finish, their team was punctual, professional, and incredibly friendly.\n\nNot only did they complete the job efficiently, but they also took the time to explain what they were doing and made sure I understood the entire process. They even offered helpful advice on future improvements I might consider for my home’s plumbing system - without any pressure.\n\nIt’s rare these days to find a company that combines great technical work with such personable customer service. I’m very glad to have found them and will absolutely be using them for all my plumbing needs moving forward.\n\nHighly recommend!",

      "text": "Stephen was excellent, super experienced knowledgable and *honest* at time when we really needed a reliable professional plumber to step up and close the deal on a kitchen renovation contract with a major home improvement company that was making a mess.  Stephen saved us and delivered great results at a fair price in the clutch that saved the entire project from going off the rails.",
