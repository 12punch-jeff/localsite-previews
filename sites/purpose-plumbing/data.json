      "text": "I had made an appointment to have my tankless water heater descaled. It's a yearly maintenance. Boy am I glad I called back to find out how much it was going to cost! Last year it was $250 which is a little high but I could swing it. This year it's $400!! I cancelled the appointment. I can get the same service for $150. The chemicals cost $30 on Amazon & takes an hour to do. Certainly not worth $400! Eventhough they do good work, they're outpricing themselves in the plumbing field.",

      "text": "Had them come to take a look at our shower. The plumber never listened to us describe the problem or bother attempting any troubleshooting. They charged us around $400 for a part we didn’t need, installed it improperly, and left without fixing the issue. I had to get involved and fix the issues that they caused on my own and still don’t have a functioning shower.",

      "text": "Took only an hour to put the tank in. Took over three weeks to attempt to put the enclosure on the outdoor tank. They did not take the time to measure what they would need to put on the enclosure so it did not happen. I sent them away ..technician Scotty had a very bad attitude. He was passive aggressive. Wanted to blame me for his bad judgment. The job was not completed. They sure $2000 to install the heater and the expansion tank. $1000 labor for one hour. Very greedy.",

I only needed a washer replaced and they told me they needed to make two holes in my wall and replace everything for $1,600!  I got Simply Plumbing to fix the washer for about $400.  Call Simply Plumbing.",
