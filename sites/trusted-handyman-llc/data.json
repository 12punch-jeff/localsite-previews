Stephen, the owner, was quick to respond and made scheduling easy, getting everything taken care of in a timely manner and at a fair price. I really appreciate their reliability and quality of work. Highly recommend!",

      "text": "I hired “Trusted handyman” and wish I hadn’t…..I found them on Nextdoor and some lady there tried to warn me off so thought it only prudent to post my negative experience.\n\nI Hired him for a simple bathtub installation. Came on a Thursday and installed the tub without the required rim boards which is required by the installation instructions and was discussed in writing prior. When I reminded him day before they must be installed his response was “we know”. Then they didn’t install. Quite the attitude for what’s the come….\n\nHe came back out on Friday to add the boards and reinstall. While I’m at work him and his counterpart text me multiple times job is complete now and they want payment. He threatens to sue me for payment on Monday…again this is the SAME DAY they finished within a couple hours since the job is “complete”. Stephen sounded like a desperate money hungry psychopath in my opinion. Alarm bell starts ringing….\n\nI tell them especially since previous days misinstallation I will inspect it and water test before paying them. They try making excuse that “you also can’t use water until tile is installed”. What a lie! Thank goodness I didn’t listen.\n\nSo the next morning I cut off the tube he had blocked and ran the water and guess what? It leaking like a wide open sieve and damaged the ceiling below. (Video below)\n\nLong story short I had to hire an actual plumber who tore out and redid all their shoddy work. The plumbing they did to the spout didn’t meet code either and was off center. No washer or propert sealant was installed on the tub drain which is why it leaked. Was also installed way off center. No fasteners were installed in the tub either. It’s hard finding ANYTHING that was done properly.\n\nHe even had the gall to state “you telling us how to do the work and I’m just wondering why you just didn’t do it yourself?? We did a good job at a fair price.”\n\nI regret hiring them and wouldn’t recommend…to say the least. Photos and video below.\n\nBased on previous reviews he's going to say this is \"Fake\" and he never worked for me. He doesn't do contracts? Just to get ahead of that....I've posted our contract.\n\nHe's also not licensed in the state of South Carolina to perform plumbing work..…",

      "text": "Stephen and his technician, Sean, did an incredible job turning my Pinterest vision into a reality when we turned our guest room into our son’s “big boy room”. Sean was always courteous when coming and going and did his best to clean up after himself. Stephen’s price was fair and he was easy to contact with questions and concerns. We will surely have them out for more work in the future and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them.",

      "text": "Wow if I could do 100 reviews to boost their stars I would! Hands down the best crews and leader Steve. He was onsite every day,  check in every morning and afternoon. They went above and beyond to ensure the work was aligned with our needs and requirements to code. Any job moving forward we will be working with Steve and his crew!  They remediated mold damage, removed and replaced 2200 sqft of Sheetrock, painted and did electrical. Next building a bar and finishing a basement.",
